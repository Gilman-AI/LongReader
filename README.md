# LongReader: OpenAI TTS Without Limits

**LongReader** is a collection of Python scripts and modules designed to convert long text files into high-quality M4A audio files. It leverages the power of the OpenAI Text-to-Speech API and the Anthropic API to preprocess text, generate natural-sounding speech, and handle long texts efficiently by processing them asynchronously in chunks.

## Features

- Converts `.txt` files to `.m4a` audio files.
- Utilizes asynchronous processing for efficient handling of long texts.
- Rewrites text for natural speech synthesis using the Anthropic API.
- Generates speech audio using the OpenAI Text-to-Speech API.
- Speeds up audio playback using `pyrubberband` for a more efficient listening experience.
- Handles text chunking without breaking sentences for seamless audio output.
- Provides configurable options, including voice selection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (must be installed and added to your PATH)
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) language model `en_core_web_trf`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gilman-AI/longreader.git
   cd longreader
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the spaCy Language Model**

   ```bash
   sh scripts/download_models.sh
   ```

5. **Ensure FFmpeg is Installed**

   - **Linux/macOS**: Install via package manager or download from [FFmpeg's website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   - **Windows**: Download the executable and add it to your PATH.

6. **Set Environment Variables**

   - **OpenAI API Key**

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
     ```

   - **Anthropic API Key**

     ```bash
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key'
     ```

     *On Windows, use `set` instead of `export`.*

## Usage

The main script `ReadToM4A.py` is used to convert a text file into an M4A audio file.

```bash
python scripts/ReadToM4A.py [--voice VOICE] <input_file.txt> <output_file.m4a>
```

- `<input_file.txt>`: Path to the input text file.
- `<output_file.m4a>`: Path for the output M4A audio file.
- `--voice VOICE`: (Optional) Specify the OpenAI voice to use. Default is `'alloy'`.

### Example

```bash
python scripts/ReadToM4A.py --voice 'alloy' input.txt output.m4a
```

## Configuration

- **Voice Selection**: You can choose different voices offered by the OpenAI TTS API using the `--voice` option.
- **Concurrency Limits**: Adjust the semaphores in `longreader.py` to change the number of concurrent API requests.
  - `anthropic_semaphore = Semaphore(<desired_number>)`
  - `openai_semaphore = Semaphore(<desired_number>)`
- **spaCy Model**: The `en_core_web_trf` model is used for sentence splitting. It is the highest-quality native spaCy model, but also the largest and slowest. On slower machines, consider using the `en_core_web_sm` model instead.

## Examples

### Basic Conversion

Convert `article.txt` to `article.m4a` using the default voice:

```bash
python scripts/ReadToM4A.py article.txt article.m4a
```

### Using a Specific Voice

Use the `'onyx'` voice for conversion:

```bash
python scripts/ReadToM4A.py article.txt article.m4a --voice 'onyx'
```

### Adjusting Concurrency

To process more chunks concurrently, modify the semaphores in `longreader.py`:

```python
# longreader.py
anthropic_semaphore = Semaphore(5)   # Increase from 3 to 5
openai_semaphore = Semaphore(5)
```

### Adjusting the spaCy Model

To use the smaller `en_core_web_sm` model, change the `spacy_model` variable in `ReadToM4A.py`:

```python
spacy_model = spacy_load('en_core_web_sm')
```

You will need to download the `en_core_web_sm` model separately:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
